Paying in blood:</strong> she suffers a number of Wounds equal to her current Lashes.<br><strong>2. Paying in misfortune:</strong> she gives the GM 1 Danger Point for each Lash she currently has.<br><br>After a Witch rolls dice for a Risk, the GM may spend 1 Danger Point to prevent her from using any die result lower than her current number of Lashes.<br>By spending an additional Danger Point, the GM may apply this effect to a different Hero instead of the Witch: Fate will be repaid one way or another. For example, a Witch with 4 Lashes cannot use results of 1, 2, or 3 to create Raises."
